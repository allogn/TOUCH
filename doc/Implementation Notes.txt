========= Some notes about mistakes and guidlines for further development ===========

--------- CUDA -----------
Use .cu extension only in case if there is <<< ... >>> function
Thrust library is completely for .cpp files.
So, for parallelization create .cu file, include it in cpp file and then call __host__ function (not __global__!!!)


--------- GitHub ---------
Use Sequential branch for developing and commiting changes as often as possible
Use Master branch for WORKING copy AND for run experiments. Note:
    script generations and all ./run folder in under master
    doc folder is under both
    code is under sequential (do not compile it under master)
Use Experimental to show something strange or try something hopeless
